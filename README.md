# Rescue Animal Capstone Project

## WIP

This repository stores enhancements to a full stack application for my computer science capstone.

Enhancement One (1/22/2022): 
- Structured the project
- Configured the backend and middleware
- Implemented the form to intake a new animal
- Added front end navigation

Enhancement Two (1/30/2022):
- Implemented the search grid and filters for search and rescue animals
- Added a table to sort all animals


Run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` in both the backend and frontend folders.
Note: Make sure to start the backend server first.
