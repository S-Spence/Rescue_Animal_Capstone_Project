# Rescue Animal Capstone Project

## WIP

This repository stores enhancements to a full stack application for my computer science capstone.

Enhancement One (1/22/2022): 
- Structured the project
- Configured the backend and middleware
- Implemented the form to intake a new animal
- Added front end navigation


Run ```npm install``` in both the backend and frontend folders.
Then, run ```npm start``` to launch the project.
